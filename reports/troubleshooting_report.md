### The Goal
Our goal is to connect the Gemini CLI to your live Oracle Cloud APEX application using two MCP servers: `oracle-sqlcl` and `apex-custom`.

### Summary of What We've Done So Far:

1.  **Initial Setup & Discovery (Success):**
    *   We successfully set up a local Docker database and installed APEX inside it.
    *   We configured the Python environment and `sqlcl`.
    *   We discovered this local setup was not your goal.

2.  **Pivoting to the Cloud Application (The Start of the Problem):**
    *   You provided the connection details for your Oracle Cloud APEX application.
    *   We updated our configuration files (`.env`, `settings.json`, `GEMINI.md`) to point to your cloud database.
    *   We downloaded your Oracle Wallet, which is required for a secure TCPS connection.

3.  **The First Error: `ORA-28759: failure to open file`**
    *   When we tried to connect `sqlcl` to the cloud database, we got this error.
    *   **Diagnosis:** This error almost always means the program (in this case, the Java process running `sqlcl`) does not have permission to read the wallet files, or cannot find them.

4.  **Troubleshooting Attempts (A Series of Unfortunate Events):**
    *   **TNS_ADMIN:** We tried explicitly setting the `TNS_ADMIN` environment variable to point to the wallet. This failed, suggesting the variable was being ignored or overridden.
    *   **Redirects:** We tried creating a `sqlnet.ora` file in the default Instant Client directory to redirect it to the wallet. This also failed with TNS errors.
    *   **File Permissions:** We tried changing file permissions (`chmod`) and ownership (`chown`) on the wallet and Instant Client directories. This did not resolve the `ORA-28759` error.
    *   **Java Diagnostics:** We created a custom Java program to isolate the issue. This led us to the next major error.

5.  **The Second Error: `KeyStoreException: SSO not found`**
    *   Our Java test program revealed this error.
    *   **Diagnosis:** This means the Java environment itself is missing the specific Oracle security provider needed to understand the Oracle Wallet's SSO (Single Sign-On) format.

6.  **Further Troubleshooting:**
    *   **java.security:** We tried to fix this by modifying the main `java.security` file to add the Oracle providers. This did not work.
    *   **Command-Line Override:** We tried to force Java to load the providers from the command line. This led to the final, critical error.

7.  **The Third Error: `InternalError: SHA-1 not available`**
    *   **Diagnosis:** This showed that by forcing the Oracle security providers, we broke Java's access to its own fundamental security algorithms. This proves a deep incompatibility between the Homebrew-installed Java and the Oracle libraries.

### Where We Are Now

We have successfully proven that the root cause is a fundamental incompatibility within the **Java environment** itself. It is not a simple configuration mistake. The Homebrew version of OpenJDK 17 you have installed is not working correctly with the Oracle security libraries required for a wallet connection.
