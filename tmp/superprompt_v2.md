**Problem Context:**

I am an AI assistant (Gemini) attempting to list Oracle APEX applications within a specific workspace (`PASS-BD`) using a direct database connection. My connection is established via the `APEX_MCP_USER` database user. Despite extensive troubleshooting, I am unable to retrieve any APEX application metadata.

**Environment Details:**

*   **Database Host:** ybqcjfnkpl5itmo-qik84h5rgwho9el0.adb.eu-amsterdam-1.oraclecloudapps.com:1522
*   **Database Service:** YBQCJFNKPL5ITMO_QIK84H5RGWHO9EL0_low.adb.oraclecloud.com
*   **APEX Workspace (confirmed by user):** PASS-BD (Workspace ID: 7857705588416879)
*   **APEX Schema (confirmed by user):** WKSP_PASSAPORTEDIGITAL
*   **My Database Connection User:** APEX_MCP_USER (This is a direct database user, not an APEX application user).
*   **APEX Application ID:** 100
*   **APEX Application Alias:** PASSAPORTE-COMPETÃŠNCIAS-DIGITAIS
*   **APEX Authentication Scheme:** Oracle APEX Accounts
*   **APEX Authorization Schemes:** Custom PL/SQL functions (e.g., `is_coordenador`, `is_formador`)

**Steps Taken and Observations:**

1.  **Initial Attempts (Gemini CLI):**
    *   `list_apex_applications(workspace_name="PASS-BD")` returned `count: 0, applications: []`.
    *   Direct SQL query `SELECT application_id, application_name, workspace FROM apex_applications` as `APEX_MCP_USER` returned `no rows selected`.
2.  **Schema Visibility:**
    *   `APEX_MCP_USER`'s `CURRENT_SCHEMA` is `APEX_MCP_USER`.
    *   Attempted `ALTER SESSION SET CURRENT_SCHEMA = WKSP_PASSAPORTEDIGITAL;` failed with `ORA-01435: user does not exist`.
    *   `WKSP_PASSAPORTEDIGITAL` was not listed in `ALL_USERS` for `APEX_MCP_USER`.
    *   User confirmed `PASS-BD` workspace and `WKSP_PASSAPORTEDIGITAL` schema exist and contain applications via APEX SQL Workshop.
3.  **Permission Grant Attempts:**
    *   User attempted `GRANT APEX_ADMINISTRATOR_ROLE TO APEX_MCP_USER;` via APEX SQL Workshop, failed with `ORA-01932: ADMIN option not granted`.
    *   User (acting as DBA) successfully granted `APEX_ADMINISTRATOR_ROLE` to `APEX_MCP_USER` via Oracle Autonomous Database Web Portal (Database Actions).
    *   Confirmed grant via `DBA_ROLE_PRIVS` showed `APEX_ADMINISTRATOR_ROLE` granted to `APEX_MCP_USER` with `ADMIN_OPTION = NO`.
4.  **Post-Grant Attempts (Gemini CLI):**
    *   Disconnected and reconnected the database session for `APEX_MCP_USER`.
    *   `list_apex_applications(workspace_name="PASS-BD")` *still* returned `count: 0, applications: []`.
    *   Direct SQL query `SELECT application_id, application_name, workspace FROM apex_applications` *still* returned `no rows selected`.
    *   Querying `APEX_WORKSPACES` for `PASS-BD` as `APEX_MCP_USER` returned `no rows selected`.
5.  **Explicit APEX Context Setting Attempt:**
    *   Attempted PL/SQL block using `APEX_UTIL.SET_SECURITY_GROUP_ID` and `APEX_UTIL.SET_WORKSPACE` with the provided `WORKSPACE_ID` (`7857705588416879`).
    *   This failed with `ORA-20987: APEX - Security Group ID (your workspace identity) is invalid.`.
6.  **MCP Server Connectivity:** Confirmed that the underlying Python MCP server *is* successfully connecting to the database; the issue is with data retrieval, not basic connectivity.

**Core Problem:** Even with `APEX_ADMINISTRATOR_ROLE` granted to `APEX_MCP_USER`, and explicit attempts to set the APEX session context, `APEX_MCP_USER` cannot see APEX application or workspace metadata via a direct database connection in this Autonomous Database environment. The `ORA-20987` error suggests a fundamental issue with establishing a valid APEX identity for this user.

**Questions for the other AI (with preference for Oracle Web Portal/Gemini CLI solutions):**

1.  Given that `APEX_ADMINISTRATOR_ROLE` is granted and `APEX_UTIL.SET_SECURITY_GROUP_ID`/`APEX_UTIL.SET_WORKSPACE` failed with `ORA-20987`, what is the *exact* and *minimal* set of actions required (preferably via Oracle Autonomous Database Web Portal's Database Actions or APEX Administration Services UI) to enable `APEX_MCP_USER` to successfully query `APEX_APPLICATIONS` and `APEX_WORKSPACES`?
2.  Is there a specific configuration within the Oracle Autonomous Database Web Portal (e.g., in Database Actions, or APEX Administration Services) that needs to be adjusted for `APEX_MCP_USER` to gain the necessary visibility and context for APEX metadata?
3.  Does the `ORA-20987` error, in this specific Autonomous Database context, indicate a fundamental limitation for direct database users like `APEX_MCP_USER` to establish an APEX session context, even with `APEX_ADMINISTRATOR_ROLE`? If so, what is the recommended workaround or alternative for programmatic access to APEX metadata?
4.  Are there any specific `APEX_SESSION` or `APEX_UTIL` procedures that *must* be called in a particular sequence or with specific parameters to enable a direct database user to see APEX metadata, and can these be executed via Gemini CLI's `run_sql` tool?
5.  What is the recommended best practice for setting up a database user for programmatic, read-only access to APEX application metadata in an Oracle Autonomous Database environment, specifically when the goal is to list applications and workspaces?

**Goal:** Enable Gemini to successfully list APEX applications and workspaces from a direct database connection, with a strong preference for solutions implementable via the Oracle Autonomous Database Web Portal (Database Actions/APEX Administration Services) or direct Gemini CLI `run_sql` actions.
