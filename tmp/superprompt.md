**Problem Context:**

I am an AI assistant (Gemini) trying to help a user manage their Oracle APEX applications. My primary task is to list APEX applications within a specific workspace. I connect to the Oracle database directly using a dedicated database user (`APEX_MCP_USER`).

**Environment Details:**

*   **Database Host:** ybqcjfnkpl5itmo-qik84h5rgwho9el0.adb.eu-amsterdam-1.oraclecloudapps.com:1522
*   **Database Service:** YBQCJFNKPL5ITMO_QIK84H5RGWHO9EL0_low.adb.oraclecloud.com
*   **APEX Workspace (as per .env and user confirmation):** PASS-BD
*   **APEX Schema (as per user confirmation from APEX SQL Workshop):** WKSP_PASSAPORTEDIGITAL
*   **APEX Application ID:** 100
*   **APEX Application Name:** heldertou
*   **APEX Application Alias:** PASSAPORTE-COMPETÃŠNCIAS-DIGITAIS
*   **My Database Connection User:** APEX_MCP_USER (This user is used for direct SQL connections, not an APEX workspace user).

**Steps Taken and Observations:**

1.  **Initial Attempt (AI Tool):** Used `list_apex_applications(workspace_name="PASS-BD")`. Result: `count: 0, applications: []`.
2.  **Direct SQL Query (AI Tool):** Executed `SELECT application_id, application_name, workspace FROM apex_applications` as `APEX_MCP_USER`. Result: `no rows selected`.
3.  **Schema Verification (AI Tool):**
    *   `SELECT SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV', 'CURRENT_SCHEMA') FROM DUAL;` returned `APEX_MCP_USER`.
    *   `SELECT USER FROM DUAL;` returned `APEX_MCP_USER`.
    *   Attempted `ALTER SESSION SET CURRENT_SCHEMA = WKSP_PASSAPORTEDIGITAL;` failed with `ORA-01435: user does not exist`.
    *   `SELECT username FROM ALL_USERS;` did *not* list `WKSP_PASSAPORTEDIGITAL`.
4.  **User Confirmation (APEX SQL Workshop):** The user, logged into their APEX SQL Workshop (presumably as a workspace administrator or developer), executed:
    ```sql
    SELECT workspace, owner AS schema_utilizador FROM apex_applications ORDER BY workspace;
    ```
    This query *successfully* returned: `PASS-BD, WKSP_PASSAPORTEDIGITAL` (among other results), confirming the existence of the workspace, schema, and applications.
5.  **Permission Grant Attempt (User via APEX SQL Workshop):** User attempted to execute `GRANT APEX_ADMINISTRATOR_ROLE TO APEX_MCP_USER;`. Result: `ORA-01932: ADMIN option not granted for role 'APEX_ADMINISTRATOR_ROLE'`.
6.  **Current Status:** I am awaiting the user to provide details on the application's Authentication and Authorization Schemes, and I have initiated a web search for how to grant `APEX_ADMINISTRATOR_ROLE` via the APEX UI.

**Core Problem:** The `APEX_MCP_USER` cannot see APEX applications when connecting directly to the database, even though the applications exist and the user has attempted to grant permissions. The `WKSP_PASSAPORTEDIGITAL` schema is not visible to `APEX_MCP_USER` in a direct connection context.

**Questions for the other AI:**

1.  Given the `ORA-01932` error, what is the most effective way for the user (who has APEX workspace admin access but not full DBA privileges) to grant `APEX_ADMINISTRATOR_ROLE` (or equivalent privileges) to the `APEX_MCP_USER`? Are there specific steps within the APEX Administration Services UI to achieve this?
2.  Why would `WKSP_PASSAPORTEDIGITAL` be visible to the user in APEX SQL Workshop but not to `APEX_MCP_USER` via a direct database connection, even though the user confirmed its existence? What is the underlying mechanism for schema visibility in this context?
3.  What are the *minimum* database privileges (specific `GRANT` statements on views, tables, or roles) required for a standard database user (like `APEX_MCP_USER`) to successfully query `APEX_APPLICATIONS` and see all applications within a specified workspace (e.g., `PASS-BD`) from a direct SQL connection?
4.  Are there any alternative APEX views or PL/SQL packages that can be queried by a less privileged database user to retrieve APEX application metadata, if `APEX_APPLICATIONS` requires `APEX_ADMINISTRATOR_ROLE`?
5.  Could the issue be related to the APEX application's Authentication or Authorization Schemes preventing direct database access to metadata? If so, how can this be identified and potentially mitigated?
6.  What is the recommended best practice for setting up a database user for programmatic access to APEX application metadata (e.g., for tools like mine)?
